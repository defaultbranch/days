  <h1>AIL Madrid</h1>

  <p>
    I came to spent three months in the Spanish language school <a href="https://www.ailmadrid.com/" target="_blank">AIL
      Madrid</a>; this is my story behind.
  </p>

  <h2>The Pretext</h2>

  <p>
    In the past I had visited Spain a few times: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seville"
      target=”_blank”>Seville</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andalusia"
      target="_blank">Andalusia</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tenerife" target="_blank">Tenerife</a>…
    several weeks in total. I had also started to learn the language, first from travel guides, then from learn-at-home
    courses… to get more familiar with, I even had begun to watch some DVDs in that language, and had bought some books
    during my travels… I was a bit familiar with the language already.
  </p>

  <p>
    In 2023, the company's project I was working for was cut short a bit; I wasn't exactly fired but I wasn't fully
    employed any longer either. So there was still work to do, the project still needed me short-term, but with no funds for a full
    salary. What began with a transition phase – to continue part-time while looking for a new job – luckily became something
    like a remote-work sabatical: I had not taken much vacation in the previous year, so now I went to Spain for two
    weeks, cramping the working hours of the first part-time month into the days before and after that trip.
  </p>

  <p>
    And since I already was in Spain, why not also learn the language first hand? So I enrolled at a language school for the
    days. The experience was good, and when I returned home after these first two weeks, I negociated with my company to
    continue part-time from remote for three more months, allowing me to work from Spain.
  </p>

  <p>
    This is how I ended up taking three months of Spanish classes in Spain in the morning and working remotely in the
    afternoons.
  </p>

  <p>
    (One missing piece here is: After the two weeks in Spain, I and my eldest teenage daughter spent a another week in
    my sister's home town <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gotha" target="_blank">Gotha</a>, and there while
    reflecting on the previous stay, I somehow mentioned that it would be nice to stay for longer; and then my daughter
    somehow continued: let's go together (…it would be unfair to leave Mom alone with all the kids; …I wanted to learn
    Spanish one day anyway). As it turned out: With that, we had enough pretext to go.)
