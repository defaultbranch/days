    In my past I had allready visited Spain a few times: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seville"
      target=”_blank”>Seville</a>, the surrounding <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andalusia"
      target="_blank">Andalusia</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tenerife" target="_blank">Tenerife</a>…
    several weeks in total. I had also started to learn the language, first from travel guides, then from learn-at-home
    courses… to get more familiar with, I even had begun to watch some DVDs in that language, and had bought some books
    during my travels. In short, I already was a bit familiar with the language.

  <p>
    In 2023, the company's project I was working for was cut short a bit; I wasn't exactly fired but I wasn't fully
    employed any longer either. So there was still work to do, the project still needed me, but with no funds for a full
    salary. What began with a transition phase – continue part-time while looking for a new job – became something
    like a remote-work sabatical: I had not taken much vacation in the previous year, so now I went to Spain for two
    weeks, cramping the working hours of the first part-time month into the days before and after that trip.

  <p>
    And since I already was in Spain, why not learn the language first-hand? So I enrolled at a language school for the
    days. The experience was good, and when I returned home after these first two weeks, I negociated with my company to
    continue part-time from remote for three more months, allowing me to work from Spain.

  <p>
    This is how I ended up taking three months of Spanish classes in Spain in the morning and working remotely in the
    afternoons.
